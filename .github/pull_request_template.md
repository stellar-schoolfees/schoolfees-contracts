# Review checklist

- [ ] I read AGENTS.md and CONTRIBUTING.md.
- [ ] The diff contains no secret material, .env contents, or personal data; examples are synthetic.
- [ ] Testnet-only status and limitations remain accurate; no deployment or pilot evidence is invented.
- [ ] For interface, errors, events, or storage changes, I updated the relevant documentation and regression coverage.
- [ ] I described remaining risks and any checks not run.
